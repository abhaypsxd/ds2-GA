## EVs and Japan:

- Japan’s transition to electric vehicles (EVs) has just begun. In the near future, Japanese consumers and businesses will seek American EV products and solutions, presenting U.S. companies with increasing business opportunities in components, systems, software and aftermarket products.

- Japan’s passenger EV market set record sales in 2022. According to the Japan Automobile Dealers Association (JADA) and Japan Mini Vehicles Association (Zenkeijikyo), in 2022, 58,813 battery electric vehicles (BEVs) were sold in Japan, which was 2.7 times more than in 2021. The BEV ratio (BEVs share of passenger car sales) grew to 1.7% in 2022, surpassing 2021 (0.6%) and exceeding the 1% threshold for the first time. BEV sales in Japan are expected to further increase as Japan targets 100% environmentally friendly vehicles by 2035, and as consumers consider the environmental and economic benefits of EVs.

-The recent growth in BEV sales in Japan was led by a booming demand for Kei EVs. Kei cars translate as “light-weight automobiles” and are Japan’s smallest highway-legal passenger cars with restricted dimensions and engine capacity. Kei EV sales grew from 554 units in 2021 to 27,221 units in 2022 and accounted for 46.3% of total BEV sales. The best-selling Kei EV models were the Nissan Sakura and Mitsubishi eK X EV. Both cars received the “Japan Car of the Year” award; this marks the first time Kei EVs have been selected in the award’s 43-year history.

### Tax incentive Measures:

<p align="left">
    To help expedite the shift to low-carbon road transport in the interest of curbing global warming and to help 
improve air quality, the Japanese government has, since April 2009, applied auto-related tax incentives to promote 
the wider use of eco-friendly vehicles.  Updated incentives and eligibility requirements came into effect in April and 
May 2021 and their effective periods were extended for two years.  Incentives for the acquisition tax expired at the 
end of September 2019 when the acquisition tax was abolished.

#### Enviromental performance based Tax Reductions:

<p align="center">
  <img src="taxReduction.png" alt="Title">
</p>

- From October 1, 2019, an automotive environmental performance-based tax came into effect as an adjunct provision to the automobile tax and the mini-vehicle tax. It is imposed at the time of vehicle (passenger car, mini-vehicle, heavy-duty vehicle, etc.) purchase and calculated on the basis of the vehicle’s environmental (i.e., fuel efficiency, emissions) performance and its purchase price.
- The tax applies to both new and used vehicles, with the exception of vehicles purchased for ¥500,000 or less, which are exempted from the tax.
- The fuel efficiency and other environmental performance criteria on the basis of which the tax’s varying rates (e.g., from 0% to 3% for passenger vehicles and from 0% to 2% for commercial vehicles and mini-vehicles) have been determined are in line with criteria established in Japan’s Energy Conservation Law. Highly fuel-efficient as well as electrified and other designated vehicles are exempted from the tax

#### Conclusion:

<p align="centre">
    In order to stimulate demand for EVs, the Japanese government continues to offer subsidies for purchases of new EVs with a revised budget of 70 billion Japanese Yen (approximately US$501 million) for fiscal year 2022. The subsidy amounts for new purchases are 650,000 Japanese Yen (US$4,656) for BEVs, 450,000 Japanese Yen (US$3,223) for Kei EVs and Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), and 2,300,000 Japanese Yen (US$16,474) for Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs). If a vehicle meets certain requirements, such as having a power supply function that can draw power from an onboard outlet (1500W/AC100V), or a capability of extracting power via an external power supply or V2H charger, the vehicle may qualify for a higher subsidy amount. In this case, the maximum subsidies are 850,000 Japanese Yen (US$6,089) for BEVs, 550,000 Japanese Yen (US$3,940) for Kei EVs and PHEVs, and 2,550,000 Japanese Yen (US$18,268) for FCEVs.</p>

## GLOBAL INFLUENCE

### OVERSEAS PRODUCTION BY JAPANESE AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURERS:

- The Japanese automobile manufacturers have been expanding their overseas production bases in order to reduce the impact of exchange rate fluctuations and to strengthen their global competitiveness.
- The overseas production volume of Japanese automobile manufacturers in 2019 was 19.5 million units, which was 1.3 times the domestic production volume of 9.5 million units.
- The global operations of Japanese automobile manufacturers continue to grow, focusing on on-site manufacturing
  to meet local needs. Whether as independent operations, joint ventures or technical tie-ups, local manufacturing
  activities are conducted in numerous countries around the world.

</p>

- The above table gives a big picture of the overseas production of Japanese automobile manufacturers.

### Geographical Distribution of Japanese Automakers’ Overseas Production Bases:

- Japanese automobile manufacturers have developed local production operations, whether as wholly-owned subsidiaries or as joint ventures, in the United States, Europe, Southeast Asia, China, Russia and other countries with emerging markets. These
  operations contribute to the strengthening of local economies through employment creation, local parts purchasing and, in many cases, export revenue for the host countries. Locally produced automobile parts such as engines and transmissions, as
  well as finished vehicles of some models, are exported to Japan and other destinations

#### The map provides insights into the global presence of Japanese automakers.

- Asia Dominance: A significant concentration of production bases is observed in Asia, particularly in China and Southeast Asian countries. This reflects strategic decisions to tap into these large markets.
- Europe and North America: Japanese automakers also have a strong foothold in Europe and North America. These regions are crucial for exports and catering to local demand.
- Strategic Factors: The distribution pattern may be influenced by factors such as market demand, labor costs, trade regulations, and supply chain efficiency.

##### Business Implications:

- Market Access: Having production bases in various regions ensures better access to local markets and reduces transportation costs.
- Risk Diversification: Diversification across continents mitigates risks related to geopolitical events, natural disasters, or economic downturns.
- Supply Chain Resilience: A well-distributed network enhances supply chain resilience, especially during disruptions (e.g., pandemic-related lockdowns).
- Competitive Advantage: Being close to key markets allows for quicker response to changing consumer preferences and regulatory requirements.

- In summary, this map reflects the strategic decisions of Japanese automakers in establishing production bases worldwide, balancing market access, risk management, and operational efficiency

### Japanese Automakers Forge Extensive International Alliances:

- With economic globalization, Japanese automobile manufacturers have rapidly adapted to the needs of individual
  markets, not only by shifting production to those markets but also by forging extensive alliances with overseas
  manufacturers.
- Various forms of partnership currently exist among Japanese, U.S. and European
  automakers—including capital and technical tie-ups, joint R&D and production operations, and cooperative sales
  ties—and such arrangements are expanding yearly. With the rapid growth of motorization in China and Southeast
  Asia, Japanese automakers have been actively building relationships with local manufacturers there on the basis of
  capital tie-ups and the supply of production as well as environment- and safety-related technologies.
