## GLOBAL INFLUENCE

### OVERSEAS PRODUCTION BY JAPANESE AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURERS:

- The Japanese automobile manufacturers have been expanding their overseas production bases in order to reduce the impact of exchange rate fluctuations and to strengthen their global competitiveness.
- The overseas production volume of Japanese automobile manufacturers in 2019 was 19.5 million units, which was 1.3 times the domestic production volume of 9.5 million units.
- The global operations of Japanese automobile manufacturers continue to grow, focusing on on-site manufacturing
  to meet local needs. Whether as independent operations, joint ventures or technical tie-ups, local manufacturing
  activities are conducted in numerous countries around the world.

- The above table gives a big picture of the overseas production of Japanese automobile manufacturers.

### Geographical Distribution of Japanese Automakers’ Overseas Production Bases:

- Japanese automobile manufacturers have developed local production operations, whether as wholly-owned subsidiaries or as joint ventures, in the United States, Europe, Southeast Asia, China, Russia and other countries with emerging markets. These
  operations contribute to the strengthening of local economies through employment creation, local parts purchasing and, in many cases, export revenue for the host countries. Locally produced automobile parts such as engines and transmissions, as
  well as finished vehicles of some models, are exported to Japan and other destinations

#### The map provides insights into the global presence of Japanese automakers.

- Asia Dominance: A significant concentration of production bases is observed in Asia, particularly in China and Southeast Asian countries. This reflects strategic decisions to tap into these large markets.
- Europe and North America: Japanese automakers also have a strong foothold in Europe and North America. These regions are crucial for exports and catering to local demand.
- Strategic Factors: The distribution pattern may be influenced by factors such as market demand, labor costs, trade regulations, and supply chain efficiency.

##### Business Implications:

- Market Access: Having production bases in various regions ensures better access to local markets and reduces transportation costs.
- Risk Diversification: Diversification across continents mitigates risks related to geopolitical events, natural disasters, or economic downturns.
- Supply Chain Resilience: A well-distributed network enhances supply chain resilience, especially during disruptions (e.g., pandemic-related lockdowns).
- Competitive Advantage: Being close to key markets allows for quicker response to changing consumer preferences and regulatory requirements.

- In summary, this map reflects the strategic decisions of Japanese automakers in establishing production bases worldwide, balancing market access, risk management, and operational efficiency

### Japanese Automakers Forge Extensive International Alliances:

- With economic globalization, Japanese automobile manufacturers have rapidly adapted to the needs of individual
  markets, not only by shifting production to those markets but also by forging extensive alliances with overseas
  manufacturers.
- Various forms of partnership currently exist among Japanese, U.S. and European
  automakers—including capital and technical tie-ups, joint R&D and production operations, and cooperative sales
  ties—and such arrangements are expanding yearly. With the rapid growth of motorization in China and Southeast
  Asia, Japanese automakers have been actively building relationships with local manufacturers there on the basis of
  capital tie-ups and the supply of production as well as environment- and safety-related technologies.

  Additional Notes:
- The tie-ups shown in the diagram primarily cover technical cooperation related to vehicle production and exclude sales tie-ups.

#### Among these, tie-ups with Chinese automakers are particularly noteworthy:

- China is the world’s largest automobile market, and Japanese automakers have been actively forming alliances with local manufacturers to tap into this lucrative market.
- These partnerships involve technology transfer, joint ventures, and co-development of new models to cater to the specific needs of Chinese consumers.
- By leveraging the expertise of local partners, Japanese automakers can navigate regulatory challenges, localize production, and enhance brand visibility in China.
